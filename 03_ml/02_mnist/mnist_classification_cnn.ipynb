    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST data set. State of the art neural network models achieve a prediction accuracy of __99.8\\%__. Remarkably, the simple model described here can reach __99\\%__ accuracy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image in the MNIST dataset is represented by a $(28, 28)$ matrix, with matrix element values in the set $[0, 1/255, \\cdots, 1]$. In practice, a __batch__ of images is stored in a 4-index tensor $\\mathbf{x}_{ncij}$ of __shape__ $(N, C, H, W)$. Think of this as a 4-dimensional array each cell of which contains a pixel value. The first index (dim = 0) labels the ordinal value (position) of an image in a batch of $N$ images; the second index (dim = 1) labels the number of __channels__, $C$, that is, image planes, which for a gray scale image is $C = 1$, and would be $C = 3$ for a red, green, blue (RGB) image, while the last two indices (dim = 2, 3) label the pixels of an image of height and width $H$ and $W$, respectively. \n",

    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical convolutional neural network (CNN) comprises an alternating sequence of convolutional and coarse-graining (or __down-sampling__) layers ending with a fully connected feedforward neural network. A convolutional layer cross-correlates its inputs with a kernel, while (typically) increasing the number of output channels. The coarse-graining layer takes in one or more image planes, that is, channels, and creates multi-channel output images of smaller size. Here is a high-level view of the model we shall fit,\n",

For example, if $\\mathbf{x}$ is a 2D tensor, e.g., a matrix, of shape (28, 28), and the window is of shape (2, 2), maxpool splits the original matrix into non-overlapping pieces of shape (2,2) and returns the maximum value within each piece, thereby creating a new matrix of shape (14, 14).\n",

    "A high-level view is a good way to represent the structure of a model.  But, it is also good to try to understand the details...at least once. As is often true, a detailed mathematical description of a complicated function is made easier using an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolutional layer\n",
    "The data into the first convolutional layer are a sequence of single channel (gray scale) images $\\mathbf{x}$ of shape $(N, 1, 28, 28)$, that is, the data  form a tensor comprising $N$ images, each with a single channel ($C = 1)$, and each a $(28, 28)$ matrix of pixels. This tensor is cross-correlated with a 4D tensor of weights $\\mathbf{w}_0$, with shape $(4, 1, 5, 5)$. We shall refer to the latter as a __kernel__ and each of its $4 \\times 1$, $(5, 5)$, matrices (or 2D tensors) as a __filter__. The first index of the kernel is the number of __output channels__ (here, 4), the second is the number of __input channels__ (here, 1). Therefore, a given $(5, 5)$ filter is identified by two indices: its output and input channel numbers. The last two indices of the kernel are the height (5) and width (5), respectively, of its filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Unfortunately, the jargon is not consistent across the machine learning literature. What we call a filter is indeed often referred to as a filter, but it is also called a kernel, and what we call a kernel, that is, a stack of one or more filters, often has no specific name attached to it!) \n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of the convolutional layer for filters with odd-numbered height and width, e.g. $(5, 5)$, can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    (\\mathbf{b}_0)_k + (\\mathbf{w}_0 \\otimes \\mathbf{x})_{nkij} &= (\\mathbf{b}_0)_k + \\sum_{c=0}^{C-1} \\sum_{r=-2}^2 \\sum_{s=-2}^2  \\mathbf{x}_{nc,\\, i+r,\\,j+s} \\, (\\mathbf{w}_0)_{kcrs}, \\quad i, j = 0,\\cdots, 27 ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where, we have chosen to label the central matrix element of a filter with the indices $(0, 0)$ and the other elements with indices that can be positive or negative integers. In the above expression, for a given pixel $i, j$, the filter labeled $k, c$, namely the matrix $(\\mathbf{w}_0)_{kc}$ with matrix elements $(\\mathbf{w}_0)_{kcrs}$, is cross-correlated with channel $c$ of input image $n$ and a sum over the cross-correlated input channels, that is, over the index $c$, is performed, resulting in $k$ output images.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the above computations to work as shown, we need (in effect) to surround each image with extra strips of pixels. This operation is called __padding__. In the following, we choose to pad each image with 2 strips of pixels, with value zero. This padding makes it possible to center the $(5, 5)$ filters on every pixel, $i, j$, of the image. Had we used, for example, $(3, 5)$ filters, the appropriate padding shape would be $(1, 2)$, that is, 1 extra strip of pixels along the top and bottom of the image and 2 extra strips along the left and right sides of the image. We are free to make other choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the input image is a $(28, 28)$ matrix padded with 2 strips of pixels around the boundary, and each filter is a $(5, 5)$ matrix,\n",
    "the output of the convolution step will be a tensor of shape $(N, 4, 28, 28)$ provided that we use a __stride__ of 1, that is, if during the cross-correlation, we shift the filters a horizontal or vertical step of 1 pixel. Other choices are possible. By\n",
    "construction, the output of this convolutional layer is $N$, 4-channel images, of the same size as the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coarse-graining layer\n",
    "A convolutional layer is usually followed by a coarse-graining, that is, down-sampling, layer that reduces the number of pixels per image. In this example, the number of pixels in the image created by the convolutional layer is reduced by a factor 2 in both directions; that is, each of the 4 channels of the $(28, 28)$ image is down-sampled into a $(14, 14)$ channel by replacing the corresponding group of pixels of shape $(2, 2)$ with a pixel whose value is set to the largest value among the group of 4 pixels.  This operation, called __max-pooling__, can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    {\\rm maxpool}(O)_{nkij} &= \\max{ \\{O_{nk,\\, 2i + r,\\, 2j + s} \\}_{r,\\,s = 0, 1} } \\quad i, j = 0,\\cdots, 13,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $O$ is the output of a convolutional layer. Again, other choices are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "After max-pooling, the output tensor has shape $(N, 4, 14, 14)$. A relu __activation function__ is applied to each element of this tensor and completes one sequence of operations: cross-correlation, down-sampling, and activation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second convolutional layer follows whose input must match the output of the previous max-pooling operation, which contains $N$ sequences of images, each with 4 channels, and each a $(14, \\, 14)$ matrix padded with a 2-pixel boundary. The kernel in this layer contains $16 \\times 4$, $(5, 5)$, filters, that is, it is of shape $(16, 4, 5, 5)$. For a given input channel $c$, each of the 16 $(5, 5)$ filters of the sub-kernel $(16, c, 5, 5)$ is cross-correlated with input channel $c$. The cross-correlated input channels are then summed pixel by pixel over the 4 channels to yield  a 16-channel output image from this layer. The output, therefore, is a tensor of shape $(N, 16, 14, 14)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a second max-pooling layer is applied, which transforms the 16-channel image of 2D size $(14, 14)$ to a 16-channel image of 2D size $(7, 7)$. The image is then flattened into a 1D tensor (basically, a 1D array) of size $16 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 784$, which are the inputs of the final linear layer with 10 outputs. Finally, a softmax function is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "The net effect of the sequence of nested layers, prior to flattening, is to transform a multi-channel input image into a multi-channel output image. The hope is that the output image captures the most relevant features of the input image thereby improving the accuracy of the subsequent classification. But, why use cross-correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the cross-correlation operation is that natural images tend to have similar features in different parts of the image. A filter that is sensitive to vertical features would tend to produce an output image that enhances vertical features, while suppressing the expression of horizontal features. It therefore seems plausible that if one could design filters that are sensitive to different image features, the set of filters could potentially transform an image into another in which the most relevant features are enhanced while the least relevant are suppressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the early days of image recognition systems, researchers tried to describe in software what they considered to be the most relevant features in images. This proved to be extremely difficult and success was limited. Today hand-coding is no longer necessary because the values of the parameters of the kernels can be determined automatically by minimizing an appropriate (average) loss function. However, the mere fact that a large number of images is needed to fit these parameters is evidence that current machine learning methods and models, while spectacularly successful, are still far removed from human learning methods and models. \n",
    "\n",
    "A young child need be shown labeled objects, cat, dog, doll, truck, car, just a few times before being able to classify them correctly. The child can do this even when the objects are presented to her in orientations that differ from the ones used during the \"training phase\". This extraordinary ability suggests that the child's brain constructs a fault tolerant model of each object using only its most relevant features and is able to match rapidly the input image with the stored, or perhaps auto-reconstructed, fault tolerant model. The model is clearly fault tolerant because the child is able to ignore \"faults\" such as viewing the objects in lighting that differs from that used during the \"training phase\", or ignoring the fact that now the car has lost a couple of wheels or the doll is now wearing different clothes and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of the truly impressive recent successes, it is clear that machine learning-based artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. Of course, it could be that the age-old goal of building machines that think like humans is simply the wrong goal. After all, there are already many instances in which researchers have inadvertently succeeded in producing machines that mimic our prejudices, which is hardly progress. Therefore, perhaps we should embrace the \"artificial\" in artificial intelligence and the possibility that these machines will inevitably \"think\" differently from us. The trick, of course, is to have them \"think\" in a way that improves the human condition. It would not be helpful if, for example, our super-intelligent machine concluded that the best way to solve climate change is to eliminate one of its culprits, namely, the species Homo sapiens!"
