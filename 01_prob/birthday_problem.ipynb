    "### Classic Birthday Problem\n",
    "What's the chance that in a randomly assembled crowd of $n$ people at least two of them have the same birthday? How large must the crowd be for that chance to be at least 50%? Assume that there are $K$ possible birthdays (usually, $K = 365$) and each birthday is equally probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Variation\n",
    "What's the chance to have *exactly* 2 people with identical birthdays, while the birthdays of all others in the crowd are unique? What crowd size maximizes the chance to have only a single duplicate birthday.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use the Python module __itertools__ to simulate the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Exercise__\n",
    "\n",
    "Derive expressions for the probabilities in terms of $K$ birthdays and crowd sizes of size $n$, $p_0, p_1, p_2$ of no duplicates, exactly one duplicate, and at least one duplicate, respectively, and compare with the probabilities estimated by simulation."
